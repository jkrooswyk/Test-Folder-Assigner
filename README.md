Test-Folder-Assigner
====================

This app allows you to Drag and Drop Test Cases into Rally Test Folders.

Limitation: The Project where test cases and test folders are created must be the same, otherwise drop function will not work.  Roll up views can see tests and folders at all levels, but may not allow drop into folders.
